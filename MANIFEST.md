Wider Targeting
---
* Mouseover targeting for ships is more generous, which should make targeting easier for small ships
* Allows targeting the nearest asteroid to the mouse using "Shift" + "Target Any" hotkey (same hotkeys that the base game uses; configurable as per normal)

Aggressive Projectiles (WIP)
---
* Missiles have more accurate targeting and can compensate for "circle of death" (i.e., where missiles just fly in a circle until they run out of fuel)
* Missiles use Gunner skill; more pronounced if the same gunner fires multiple missiles in quick succession
* Projectiles have more accurate targeting
* Battle computer has more accurate lead reticle
* Point defense weapons will start firing earlier, allowing more reliable interception

Miner Gunners
---
* Allows your gunners to mine asteroids for you. To target an asteroid, the gunner must be set to "Miner" mode. 
* Access "Miner" mode using the Weapon or Crew screens - the "set AI control" button now cycles between different firing modes.
* Includes "Defensive", which is the standard AI control, and "Miner". More firing modes will be added in the future.

Blue Collar
---
* If your character has the 'White Collar' perk, opening the Character panel will replace it with the 'Miner' perk.
* You should remove this mod once you have removed 'White Collar', and save your game.
