These mods require the BepInEx mod framework.
Install the latest 5.x (x86) release, see here for instructions: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

> **Important**: Star Valor is a 32-bit application. Make sure you choose the 32-bit version of BepinEx.

After installing BepInEx, grab the latest release of the plugin (the .dll file) from the link below and put it in the BepInEx/plugins folder inside of your Star Valor game directory: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bn4kfjyousemti0/AAAQMEH73Icp3-Yvi-WtwREZa?dl=0

> As with all mods, make sure to **back up your save game** before trying a new mod. Only download mods from reliable sources: as with everything on the internet, be careful.
